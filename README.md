# LifeOnAnInfinitePlane
This project is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life using an infinite plane to represent the game space. Instead of using a grid, this implementation uses a dictionary to represent the game space, allowing for an infinite and dynamic game space that can create new areas as needed.
